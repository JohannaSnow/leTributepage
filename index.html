<h2>Margaret Hamilton</h2>

  <h4> A timeline of Margaret's life:</h4>

<ul>
  <li><strong>1936 -</strong> Born in Paoli, Indiana </li>
  <li><strong>1954 -</strong> Graduated Hancock High School </li>
  <li><strong>1955 -</strong> Started Mathematics at University of Michigan</li>
  <li><strong>1958 - </strong> Graduated from Earlham College with a B.A. in Mathmatics with a minor in Philosophy</li>
  <li><strong>1960 -</strong> Took an interim position at MIT to develop software for predicting weather on the LGP-30 and the PDP-1 computers </li>
  <li><strong> 1961 to 1963 -</strong> Worked on the SAGE Project at Lincoln Lab, where she was one of the programmers who wrote software for the first AN/FSQ-7 computer (the XD-1), to search for "unfriendly" aircraft; she also wrote software for the Air Force Cambridge Research Laboratories. </li>
  <li><strong>1969 -</strong> Joined the Charles Stark Draper Laboratory at MIT and her team was responsible for developing in-flight software,[15] which included algorithms designed by various senior scientists for the Apollo command module, lunar lander, and the subsequent Skylab.[4][16] Another part of her team designed and developed the systems software [17] which included the error detection and recovery software such as restarts and the Display Interface Routines (AKA the Priority Displays) </li>
  <h3> Letter from Margeret about her experience of writing on the Apollo mission: The computer (or rather the software in it) was smart enough to recognize that it was being asked to perform more tasks than it should be performing. It then sent out an alarm, which meant to the astronaut, I'm overloaded with more tasks than I should be doing at this time and I'm going to keep only the more important tasks; i.e., the ones needed for landing ... Actually, the computer was programmed to do more than recognize error conditions. A complete set of recovery programs was incorporated into the software. The software's action, in this case, was to eliminate lower priority tasks and re-establish the more important ones ... If the computer hadn't recognized this problem and taken recovery action, I doubt if Apollo 11 would have been the successful moon landing it was. </p>

  <li><strong>1976-1984 - </strong> CEO of a company she co-founded called Higher Order Software (HOS) </li>
  <li><strong>1986 - </strong> Received the Augusta Ada Lovelace Award by the Association for Women in Computing. </li>
  <li><strong>2003 - </strong> Given the NASA Exceptional Space Act Award for scientific and technical contributions. </li>
  <li><strong>2009 - </strong> Received the Outstanding Alumni Award by Earlham College </li>
  <li><strong>2016 - </strong> Received the Presidential Medal of Freedom from Barack Obama, the highest civilian honor in the United States </li>
</ul>
